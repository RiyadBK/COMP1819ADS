These are sample solutions/hints. Hence, some are not completed on purpose.

More files/solution can be uploaded in the later date.

You can use the give code in 01_not_completed.py to start Ex 1. 

lucky_ids_3.txt should be used for Ex 3

lucky_ids_4.txt can be used for Ex 4, 5, 6.

ANS_01_as demo.py and ANS_02_completed.py are one of different available solutions for Ex 1 & 2.
